A comprehensive Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB application, the Tour
Packages application enables visitors to log in to the website and select a
particular tour package that interests them. Just the person who is logged in
will be able to see the tour packages and choose the one they want to see,
that is how an authorization and authentication are set up. Employee
information, including their encrypted password, was saved in the backend.
Here, users must register by providing their name, email address, and
password in order for their information to be kept in Database. Users can
even remove their accounts, in which case they will be marked as inactive in
the database and those inactive employees won't be visible. Only the trip
guide or administrator can view user records. A tour package API is
developed that includes all the tour names, start dates, prices, number of
days, and so on. If the user forgets his password, he can reset it by clicking on
"forgot password," where he will get an email with a password reset link to
his mail account. By clicking on that link, he can reset the password. If the
user feels that the current password is insufficient, he has the option to
change it.
